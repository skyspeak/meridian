### Key Components
- `RoadmapBuilder.tsx`: Main component with UI and logic
- `roadmapService.ts`: AI service for plan generation
- `types/index.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for roadmap data
- `/app/roadmap/page.tsx`: Next.js page component

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface RoadmapPlan {
  id: string;
  projectTitle: string;
  projectDescription: string;
  industry: string;
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'enterprise';
  estimatedTotalDuration: number;
  estimatedBudget: { min: number; max: number; currency: string };
  gates: RoadmapGate[];
  checkpoints: RoadmapCheckpoint[];
  resources: RoadmapResource[];
  risks: string[];
  assumptions: string[];
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI Integration**: Replace mock service with GPT-4
- **Claude Integration**: Alternative AI provider
- **Custom Training**: Industry-specific model training

### Advanced Features
- **Export Options**: PDF, Excel, or project management tool integration
